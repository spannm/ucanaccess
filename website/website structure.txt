The folder in which this file resides corresponds to the folder

/home/project-web/ucanaccess

on the web.sourceforge.net server.

The "htdocs" folder is the web root. There is also a "cgi-bin" folder that 
is currently unused (empty).

REMEMBER:

Merging website file updates into the main Git repository does NOT automatically 
deploy them to the website. We still need to upload them via SFTP using FileZilla 
or similar.
