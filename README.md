The project was originally developed by Marco Amadei, Gord Thompson and others and hosted at Sourceforge until version 5.0.1 when development ceased in 2020 and activity on the project sadly died down.

UCanAccess is a very useful piece of software. It would be a shame to see it disappear.
As for myself, I have contributed to UCanAccess in the past and continue to use it to the present day.
I have reached out to my fellow developers but could not reestablish contact.
Therefore, I have forked the latest code base from [Sourceforge](http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html) and
make it available at [Github](https://github.com/spannm/ucanaccess).
My fork is intended as a drop-in replacement. It maintains runtime compatibility to prior versions, and is published at [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.spannm/ucanaccess) (under groupId io.github.spannm).
The minimum required Java version is now Java 11.
The only compile-time dependencies continue to be Jackcess and HSQLDB/HyperSQL (both have been upgraded to recent CVE-free versions).

I hope to keep on maintaining and releasing UCanAccess, so it can continue to be useful and usable for all of us.

Your feedback, thoughts and contributions are very welcome.
